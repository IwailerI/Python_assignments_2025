# Requirements

## Input

Ask the user for their first name and last name.

**String Analysis**

1. Print the length of the first name and last name.

2. Count vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the first name.

3. Count consonants in the first name.

4. Print the first name in uppercase and lowercase.

5. Print the last name reversed.

**Loop Practice**

1. Use a for loop to print each character of the first name.

2. Use a while loop to print and remove characters from the first name until it is empty.

**Conditional Statements**

1. Compare the lengths of the first and last name.

2. Print a message:

If first name > last name → "First name is longer than last name."

If first name < last name → "Last name is longer than first name."

If equal → "First name and last name are equal in length."

**Personal Password Generator**

1. Create personal password by Combining:

First letter of first name

Last letter of last name

Total number of letters (first + last name)

**List Methods Practice**

1. Create a list of characters from your last name.

2. Use .append() to add "*" at the end.

3. Use .insert() to add "@" at the beginning.

4. Use .remove() (or .pop()) to remove a character.

5. Use .reverse() to reverse the list.

6. Print the final list.

## Example Run (with Shokoufeh Salem)
Enter your first name: Shokoufeh
Enter your last name: Salem

Length of first name: 9
Length of last name: 5
Vowels in first name: 4
Consonants in first name: 5
First name (upper): SHOKOUFEH
First name (lower): shokoufeh
Last name (reversed): melaS

Characters in first name (for loop):
S
h
o
k
o
u
f
e
h

Characters in first name (while loop):
S
h
o
k
o
u
f
e
h

Comparison result: First name is longer than last name.

Generated password: Sm14
